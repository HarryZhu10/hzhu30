2022-11-21\
time spent: 1.5 hours

### QCC: 
- Can you use post?
- Are there such things as UNRESTFUL APIs? 

### DISCO:
- You can put file names in .gitignore to prevent github from tracking
- You can use `GET url` in the terminal to get response content
- `.json()` converts the request content into dictionary
