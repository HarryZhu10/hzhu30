### QCC: 
- How do we change the alignment for labels on foundation?
- the dropdown menu for the nav bar doesn't work :(

### DISCO:
- foundation.min.css is better for server loading because there is no white space. 
- There are different classes for grids.
- There are different types of grids such as xy grids and flex grids.
