Crab isn't actually a crab. Crab was a blue dragon that was abandoned by its parents at birth. Born without wings and very overweight, 
his parents didn't believe in his ability to carry on their legacy. They thought he would bring shame to their family. A few hours after his birth,
the father dropped the poor baby dragon by the beach shore. A Devo passed by and decided to care for the lonely creature. The Devo named
the blue dragon Crab because the dragon was found at the beach and it was his favorite crustacean.

<h3>

Cheems is a silly wacky dog that is actually made of Cheeseburgers. He has a speech impediment. He has unknown origins. Although, he was born in 1879. 
Cheems is often seen with a bat and is hitting another variant of cheems with said bat. Cheems may come in a yellow tint. The cheems figurine took about 9 months to 
get delivered. He now resides under my monitor.
